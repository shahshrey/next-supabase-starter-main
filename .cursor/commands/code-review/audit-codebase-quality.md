# Audit Codebase Quality - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## 1. Identify Scope and Context

1. Determine the codebase location and scope of the review (specific directories, files, or entire project).

2. Identify the primary programming language(s), frameworks, and technology stack in use.

3. Review any existing documentation (README, architecture docs, ADRs) to understand the project's intended design and patterns.

4. Note the project's deployment target (cloud, on-premise, hybrid) and operational context.

5. Establish the baseline date for "current best practices" (October 2025) for evaluating outdated technologies.

## 2. Analyze Code Quality Issues (Categories 1-32)

### 2.1 Legacy and Maintenance Issues
