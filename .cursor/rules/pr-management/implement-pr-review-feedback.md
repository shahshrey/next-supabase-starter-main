# Implement PR Review Feedback - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## Step 1: Fetch PR Information

### 1.1 Accept PR Input from User
- Ask the user for the PR number or URL
- If URL provided, extract the PR number from it
- Validate that the PR number is valid

### 1.2 Fetch PR Metadata
- Execute: `gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json title,body,reviews,comments,files --repo <owner>/<repo>`
- Parse the JSON response to understand:
  - PR title and description
  - Files changed in the PR
  - Overall review status

### 1.3 Fetch Inline Review Comments
- Execute: `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/comments --jq '.[] | {path: .path, line: .line, body: .body, diff_hunk: .diff_hunk}'`
- This retrieves all inline code review comments with:
  - File path where comment was made
  - Line number of the comment
  - Comment text/body
  - Diff hunk for context

### 1.4 Parse and Organize Comments
- Group comments by file path
- Sort comments by line number within each file
- Create a structured list of all comments for processing
- Count total number of comments to address

### 1.5 Display Summary
- Show the user:
  - Total number of review comments found
  - List of files that have comments
  - Brief preview of comment types (if easily identifiable)

**Transition:** Once all comments are fetched and organized, proceed to analysis.

## Step 2: Analyze Review Comments

### 2.1 Categorize Each Comment
For each review comment, identify the type of change requested:
- **Quick fixes** - typos, formatting, simple corrections
- **Code simplification** - removing verbose or unnecessary code
- **Variable/function renaming** - changing names for clarity
- **Using better practices** - adding dedent(), using proper patterns
- **Refactoring logic** - restructuring code flow
- **Adding functionality** - implementing missing features
- **Documentation/comments** - improving code documentation
- **Bug fixes** - correcting errors
- **Discussion needed** - architectural decisions requiring clarification

Group changes by complexity:
- Start with quick fixes first
- Group related changes in logical batches
- Identify changes that require discussion before implementation

### 2.2 Identify Files to Modify
- Create a list of all files that need changes
- For each file, note which comments apply to it
- Read the current state of each file to understand context

### 2.3 Check for Cross-File Dependencies
- For changes involving renames or refactoring:
  - Use `grep` to search for all occurrences of variables/functions being renamed
  - Identify imports and references across the codebase
  - Check if changes in one file affect other files
- Create a dependency map showing which files are related

### 2.4 Create Change Plan
- For each comment, document:
  - What needs to change
  - Why it needs to change (based on reviewer's rationale)
  - Which specific lines/sections to modify
  - Any related changes needed in other files
- Prioritize changes that other changes depend on

### 2.5 Identify Potential Issues
- Flag potential problems like:
  - Undefined variables after renaming
  - Broken imports
  - Circular dependencies
  - Conflicting changes (if two comments contradict each other)
- Note these for extra verification during implementation

**Transition:** With a clear understanding of all changes needed, proceed to implementation.

---

## Step 3: Make Code Changes

### 3.1 Read Relevant File Sections
- For each file that needs modification:
  - Use `read_file` to load the relevant sections (with context around the change area)
  - Understand the current code structure
  - Identify exact text to replace

### 3.2 Apply Changes Systematically
- Address each review comment one at a time
- For each change:
  - Use `search_replace` tool with exact old_string and new_string
  - Ensure the old_string includes enough context to be unique
  - Verify the change was applied correctly
  - Track which comment was addressed

### 3.3 Handle Cross-File References
- If a change affects multiple files (e.g., renaming):
  - Use `grep` to find all occurrences: `grep -r "variable_name" --include="*.py" <directory>`
  - Apply changes to each file where the reference exists
  - Maintain consistency across all files

### 3.4 Handle Special Cases
- **Adding imports:** Add new import statements if needed for new functionality
- **Removing code:** Ensure removing code doesn't break dependent code
- **Refactoring:** If restructuring logic, ensure all paths are covered
- **Type changes:** Update type hints if variable types change

### 3.5 Track All Modifications
- Maintain a list of:
  - Files modified
  - Specific changes made in each file
  - Which review comment each change addresses
  - Any additional changes made to maintain consistency

**Transition:** After all changes are applied, verify correctness.

## Step 4: Verify Changes

### 4.1 Run Linter Checks
- Execute: `read_lints` on all modified files
- Check for:
  - Syntax errors
  - Style violations
  - Undefined variables
  - Import errors
  - Type checking issues
- If errors found, document them for fixing

### 4.2 Run Compilation Checks
- For Python files:
  - Execute: `python -m py_compile <file1.py> <file2.py> ...`
  - Verify all files compile without syntax errors
- For TypeScript/JavaScript files:
  - Run appropriate type checking or compilation if applicable

### 4.3 Review Git Diff
- Execute: `git diff --stat` to see summary of changes
- Execute: `git diff <specific_file>` for detailed changes
- Verify:
  - Only intended files were modified
  - Changes match what was requested in comments
  - No unintended modifications were made

### 4.4 Verify Cross-File Consistency
- For any renamed variables/functions:
  - `grep` for the old name to ensure no references remain
  - `grep` for the new name to verify all references were updated
- Check imports are still valid
- Verify function signatures match across files

### 4.5 Fix Any Issues Found
- If verification reveals problems:
  - Make corrective changes
  - Re-run all verification steps
  - Repeat until all checks pass
- Document any issues found and how they were resolved

**Transition:** Once all verifications pass, generate the summary report.

## Step 5: Generate Summary Report

### 5.1 Create Header Section
- Title: "PR Review Comments - All Addressed"
- Include:
  - PR number
  - Total comments addressed
  - Date/time of changes
  - Verification status (all checks passed)

### 5.2 List Each Comment Addressed
For each review comment, document:
- **Comment Location:** File path and line number
- **Reviewer's Request:** The exact text of the comment
- **Action Taken:** Description of what was changed
- **Code Example:** Show before/after code snippets if helpful (use git diff format)
- **Rationale:** Explain why this change addresses the comment

### 5.3 Document All Files Modified
- Create a table or list showing:
  - File path
  - Lines added/removed/modified
  - Summary of changes in that file
- Group related files together if applicable

### 5.4 Include Verification Results
- **Linter Status:** "✅ No linter errors found" or list of any warnings
- **Compilation Status:** "✅ All files compile successfully"
- **Cross-Reference Check:** "✅ No broken references found"
- **Git Status:** Show `git status` output to confirm what's staged/unstaged

### 5.5 Add Final Notes
- Remind user: "Changes are ready for review but NOT committed"
- Suggest next steps:
  - Review the changes
  - Test the functionality if needed
  - Commit when satisfied
  - Respond to PR comments indicating they've been addressed
  - Mark resolved items as resolved in GitHub
  - Thank reviewers for their feedback
  - Re-request review when ready
- Include any caveats or areas that may need manual review

### 5.6 Display Summary to User
- Present the complete summary in markdown format
- Ensure it's well-formatted and easy to read
- Include all relevant details for the user to understand what was done

**Completion:** The workflow is complete. The user now has modified files and a comprehensive summary report.

- **Solution:** Review the specific errors, adjust changes to fix them, re-verify

### Issue: Broken References After Renaming
- **Error:** Undefined variable or import errors after renaming
- **Solution:** Use comprehensive grep to find all occurrences, update all references

### Issue: Conflicting Review Comments
- **Error:** Two comments request contradictory changes
- **Solution:** Ask user for clarification on which approach to take

### Issue: Large Number of Comments
- **Error:** Too many comments to process efficiently
- **Solution:** Batch similar changes together, provide progress updates to user
</error_handling>

<best_practices>
## Best Practices for This Workflow

1. **Always verify before proceeding:** After fetching comments, show them to the user for confirmation
2. **Make minimal changes:** Only change what's specifically requested, don't add "improvements"
3. **Test incrementally:** Verify after each change or small batch of changes
4. **Preserve context:** When using search_replace, include enough context to make old_string unique
5. **Document assumptions:** If a comment is ambiguous, state your interpretation
6. **Track dependencies:** Always check for cross-file impacts of changes
7. **Never auto-commit:** Let the user review before committing
8. **Provide detailed summaries:** Users should understand exactly what changed and why
9. **Don't take feedback personally:** Approach all comments objectively and professionally
10. **Ask questions when unsure:** Seek clarification rather than making assumptions
11. **Batch similar changes together:** Group related modifications for efficiency
12. **Keep commits atomic and meaningful:** Each commit should represent a logical unit of work
13. **Be responsive to reviewer feedback:** Address comments promptly and thoroughly
14. **Test after each significant change:** Ensure functionality remains intact throughout the process
