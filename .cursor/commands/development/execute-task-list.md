<task name="Execute Task List">

<task_objective>
Perform act as a world-class developer to execute a tasklist from the `/agent-helpers/tasks` folder by reading the implementation guide, reviewing the codebase, and systematically completing all tasks in order until finished. This command helps the output will be completed tasks with appropriate git commits and a final status update.

# Execute Task List - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## 1. Verify Git Branch Status

1. Check the current git branch status:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. Verify the working directory is clean:
   - No uncommitted changes
   - On the correct branch for this work

3. If the branch is not clean:
   - DO NOT create a new branch yourself
   - Alert the user that the branch is not clean
   - Ask the user to start a new branch before proceeding
   - Wait for user confirmation before continuing

## 2. Locate and Load Task List

1. Look for task list in the `/agent-helpers/tasks` folder.

2. If the folder or task list doesn't exist:
   - Check alternative locations the user might have specified
   - Ask the user for the correct location

3. Read the complete task list file.

4. Identify if there's an implementation guide or additional context:
   - Look for files like `implementation-guide.md`, `context.md`, or similar
   - Read any provided guides completely before starting

## 3. Review Codebase

1. Perform a quick codebase review to understand:
   - Project structure and organization
   - Key files and directories relevant to the tasks
   - Coding conventions and patterns used
   - Technologies and frameworks in use

2. Use `grep` or `codebase_search` to find relevant code sections mentioned in tasks.

3. Understand dependencies between tasks to anticipate requirements.

## 4. Process Tasks Sequentially

1. For each task in order:

   **A. Read and Understand the Task:**
   - Read the task description completely
   - Identify acceptance criteria
   - Note any specific requirements or constraints
   - Check for any optional user details provided

   **B. Plan the Implementation:**
   - Identify files that need to be created or modified
   - Determine the approach to implement the task
   - Consider edge cases and error handling

   **C. Implement the Task:**
   - Make necessary code changes
   - Follow project conventions and user rules
   - Apply separation of concerns principles
   - Use early returns and functional programming patterns
   - Ensure proper error handling with try-except blocks
   - Specify `encoding="utf-8"` when using `open()` in Python

   **D. Verify the Implementation:**
   - Review code for linter errors and fix them
   - Check for duplicate functionality or unused variables
   - Ensure the implementation meets the task requirements
   - Test the changes if possible

   **E. Use Git to Review Changes:**
   - Run `git diff` to review what changed
   - Verify changes are relevant to the task
   - Ensure no unintended modifications were made

2. If you need clarification on any task:
   - Clearly state what is unclear
   - Ask the user for specific details needed
   - Wait for response before proceeding with that task

3. Continue to the next task immediately after completing the current one.

## 5. Handle Implementation Issues

1. If a task cannot be completed due to missing information:
   - Document what information is needed
   - Ask the user for clarification
   - Move to the next task if possible, or wait for response

2. If a task reveals issues with previous tasks:
   - Flag the issue immediately
   - Fix the previous task before continuing
   - Document the correction

3. If linter errors are introduced:
   - Fix them immediately before proceeding
   - Run linter again to verify fixes

## 6. Final Review and Update

1. After completing all tasks:
   - Run `git status` to see all modified files
   - Review the complete set of changes with `git diff`
   - Verify all tasks are complete and meet requirements
   - Check for any linter errors in modified files

2. Provide a concise summary to the user:
   - Number of tasks completed
   - Key files modified or created
   - Any issues encountered and how they were resolved
   - Confirmation that all tasks are done

3. Ask user if they want to commit the changes or if further review is needed.

## 7. Optional: Process User Details

1. If the user provided additional details in their message:
   - Review the optional details section
   - Incorporate any additional context or requirements
   - Adjust task execution accordingly

2. Prioritize explicit user instructions over general task descriptions.
