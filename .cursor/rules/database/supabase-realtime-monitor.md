# Supabase Realtime Monitor - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## Current Realtime Context

- Supabase realtime: Connection status and subscription management via MCP
- Application subscriptions: !`find . -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.js" | xargs grep -l "subscribe\|realtime\|channel" 2>/dev/null | head -5` active subscription code
- Performance metrics: Current connection performance and message throughput
- Error patterns: Recent realtime connection issues and debugging information
