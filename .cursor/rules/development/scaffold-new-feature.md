<task name="Scaffold New Feature">

<task_objective>
Create a well-structured foundation for a new feature following project conventions by planning the scope, setting up file structure, defining types, creating base components with tests, and documenting the feature. This command helps the output will be a fully scaffolded feature ready for implementation.

# Scaffold New Feature - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## 1. Plan the Feature

1. Ask the user for the feature name and description.

2. Define the scope clearly:
   - What problem does this feature solve?
   - What are the user stories or use cases?
   - What are the boundaries (what's in scope vs out of scope)?

3. List all components needed:
   - UI components
   - Services or API clients
   - State management needs
   - Utilities or helpers

4. Identify dependencies:
   - External libraries required
   - Internal modules or features this depends on
   - APIs or services needed

5. Review existing project structure to understand conventions:
   - File organization patterns
   - Naming conventions
   - Testing patterns
   - Documentation standards

## 2. Create File Structure

1. Determine the appropriate location for the feature based on project structure.

2. Create the base directory structure (adapt to project conventions):
   ```
   features/
     feature-name/
       components/
       hooks/
       utils/
       types.ts
       index.ts
   ```

3. If the project uses a different structure (e.g., src/components, src/services), adapt accordingly.

4. Create subdirectories as needed for the feature's complexity.

## 3. Set Up Types and Interfaces

1. Create a `types.ts` file in the feature directory.

2. Define TypeScript types/interfaces for:
   - Feature-specific data models
   - Component props
   - API request/response shapes
   - State structures

3. Export all types from the types file for reuse.

4. Keep types focused and single-purpose.

## 4. Create Base Components

1. Identify the main UI components needed for the feature.

2. For each component:
   - Create a new file in the components directory
   - Define the component with proper TypeScript types
   - Add prop interfaces with clear documentation
   - Implement basic structure and placeholders
   - Keep components focused on single responsibility

3. Create a barrel export (index.ts) in the components directory to export all components.

4. Ensure components follow project naming conventions and patterns.

## 5. Add Routing (If Needed)

1. Determine if the feature requires new routes.

2. If routing is needed:
   - Locate the project's routing configuration
   - Create route definitions following project conventions
   - Add navigation links where appropriate
   - Set up route guards or middleware if authentication/authorization is required
   - Test that routes are accessible

3. If using React Router, Next.js, or similar, follow their specific patterns.

## 6. Set Up State Management

1. Determine if the feature needs state management (Redux, Zustand, Context, etc.).

2. If needed:
   - Create state management files following project patterns
   - Define initial state
   - Create actions, reducers, or hooks as appropriate
   - Export state management utilities

## 7. Create Utilities and Helpers

1. Identify any utility functions needed for the feature.

2. Create utility files in the utils directory:
   - Pure functions for data transformation
   - Helper functions for common operations
   - Validators or formatters

3. Write unit tests for utilities (these are easiest to test).

## 8. Write Initial Tests

1. **Unit Tests for Utilities:**
   - Test each utility function with various inputs
   - Cover edge cases and error conditions
   - Ensure pure functions have deterministic outputs

2. **Component Tests:**
   - Test component rendering
   - Test prop handling
   - Test user interactions (if applicable)
   - Use project's testing library (Jest, Vitest, Testing Library, etc.)

3. **Integration Tests (if applicable):**
   - Test feature flows end-to-end
   - Test interactions between components
   - Test API integrations with mocks

4. Ensure all tests pass before proceeding.

## 9. Document the Feature

1. Create a README.md in the feature directory with:
   - Feature overview and purpose
   - Architecture and file organization
   - Component documentation (props, usage examples)
   - API documentation (if applicable)
   - Development notes and gotchas

2. Add inline documentation for complex logic.

3. Include usage examples showing how to integrate the feature.

4. Document any configuration or environment variables needed.

## 10. Final Verification

1. Review the complete feature structure:
   - [ ] File structure created and follows project conventions
   - [ ] Types defined and exported
   - [ ] Base components created with proper props
   - [ ] Tests added and passing
   - [ ] Documentation written
   - [ ] Feature exports from index.ts
   - [ ] No linter errors
   - [ ] Follows project coding standards

2. Run linter and fix any issues.

3. Ensure feature is ready for implementation or PR review.

4. Provide summary to user with next steps.
